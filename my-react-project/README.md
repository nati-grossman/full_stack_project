## Introduction

### Project Overview
This project serves as a basic infrastructure to connect a client-side React application with a server-side ASP.NET Core Web API. It demonstrates the essential steps required for enabling communication between the two, allowing the client to request data from the server and display it effectively.

### Project Goal
The goal of this project is to provide a fundamental starting point for developers looking to build applications where the frontend (React) and backend (ASP.NET Core Web API) communicate seamlessly. This structure can be extended to develop more complex applications that rely on server-client data exchange.
